LEAFLET CHALLENGE

Did only Part 1 of the assignment - quake visualization without tectonic plates.

Used the last 30 days JSON. The map is a bit busy but fun to look at. 

Added legend to css file. There is a toggle between Street Map and Topographic, as well as a legend seperating by various depths in KM. 

Also added map image.
